# 1st Year (Semester 2 | 2015)
First year Introduction to Multimedia project.
Manga Mania is a conceptual idea of providing an online PDF-based platform for reading Manga.
It is based on a hyptothetical business model concieved by my team and I, that being a subscription service.
Necessities for this project (as outlined by the lecturer) included creating a social network presence for the idea, embedding a 
video related to the idea, and implementing live feeds for the aforementioned social media accounts.
